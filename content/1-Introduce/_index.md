## Building a Serverless Application on AWS  
This project guides you through building a serverless web application using AWS services, helping you deploy an efficient, flexible, and cost-effective system.  

### Steps to Implement  
- **Create a DynamoDB table** to store application data.  
- **Build a Lambda function** to handle CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.  
- **Use S3** to store and host the web application's static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Create a CloudFront distribution** to serve static files from S3 with low latency, ensuring fast page loading speeds.  

### Expected Outcomes  
- Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.  
- You will gain hands-on experience in building serverless applications using **AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront**.  
- You will also understand how to integrate AWS services to create a complete solution, from backend to frontend.  

This project will enhance your skills in **cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS service management**, providing a strong foundation for modern applications.
